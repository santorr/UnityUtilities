# Usage

You can access for example to a specific rarity color by calling :
RarityManager.GetRarityColor(ERarity);

# Edit

If you want to add others rarity types, edit the enum 'ERarity' and fill the dictionnary 'Rareties' with others Keys/Values.
You can also add more parameters by editing the 'Rarity' class (don't forget to edit the dictionnary).
